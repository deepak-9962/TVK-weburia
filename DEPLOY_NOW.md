## 🆘 Need Help?

**If drag & drop doesn't work:**
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Make sure you're dragging the FOLDER, not just files
- Check internet connection

**If site shows errors:**
- Check `members-data.json` is valid JSON
- Run: `node validate-json.js` before deploying
- Look at browser console (F12) for errors

**If you want custom domain:**
- Buy domain from Namecheap/GoDaddy (~$12/year)
- In Netlify: Domain settings → Add custom domain
- Follow DNS setup instructions
