## Database Schema

### Relationship Used:

```sql
-- Foreign key relationship
bla_members.registered_by_employee_id ‚Üí employees.id

-- Query uses this relationship name (defined in Supabase)
bla_members_registered_by_employee_id_fkey
```

### Data Flow:

```
1. Admin logs in ‚Üí Session stored with employee ID
2. Admin registers member ‚Üí employee ID captured
3. Member data stored with registered_by_employee_id
4. Photo gallery fetches with JOIN
5. Display shows employee name
6. Export includes employee name
```

## Error Handling

### PDF Export Errors:

**Error: No data to export**
- **Cause**: No members in database
- **Message**: "‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Æµ‡ØÅ ‡Æá‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Øà (No data to export)"
- **Action**: Register members first

**Error: jsPDF not loaded**
- **Cause**: CDN failure or network issue
- **Message**: "PDF ‡Æè‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øà"
- **Action**: Check internet connection, reload page

### Excel Export Errors:

**Error: No data to export**
- **Cause**: No members in database
- **Message**: "‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Æµ‡ØÅ ‡Æá‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Øà (No data to export)"
- **Action**: Register members first

**Error: XLSX library not loaded**
- **Cause**: CDN failure or network issue
- **Message**: "Excel ‡Æè‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øà"
- **Action**: Check internet connection, reload page

### Employee Name Display Errors:

**Shows "N/A" instead of employee name**
- **Cause**: Member registered before employee tracking was added
- **Solution**: registered_by_employee_id is NULL in database
- **Fix**: Normal behavior for old records

**Shows username instead of full name**
- **Cause**: Employee doesn't have full_name in database
- **Solution**: Falls back to username
- **Display**: `registered_by.full_name || registered_by.username`

## Security Considerations

### Access Control:

‚úÖ **Export features ONLY in Admin Dashboard**
- Not accessible from public pages
- Requires admin login
- Session validation enforced

‚úÖ **Employee tracking visible to all**
- Shows in member photo gallery
- Doesn't expose sensitive employee data
- Only shows employee name, not password/ID

### Data Protection:

‚úÖ **Exported files contain:**
- Member data (already public in photo gallery)
- Employee names (not sensitive)
- No passwords or authentication data

‚úÖ **File naming:**
- Includes date for organization
- No user-specific information in filename
- Safe to share with authorized personnel

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Q: Employee name shows "N/A" for all members**  
**A:** Check database - registered_by_employee_id column may be NULL. This is normal for members registered before employee tracking was added.

**Q: PDF download fails**  
**A:** Check browser console for errors. Verify CDN libraries are loading. Try clearing cache and reload.

**Q: Excel file won't open**  
**A:** Ensure you have Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice installed. File format is .xlsx (modern Excel format).

**Q: Export button stays disabled**  
**A:** Reload the page. Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure Supabase connection is working.

**Q: Employee name shows username instead of full name**  
**A:** Employee doesn't have full_name set in database. Update employee record or this is expected behavior.

---

## SQL Queries for Verification

### Check Employee Tracking:

```sql
-- See all members with employee names
SELECT 
    m.full_name as member_name,
    m.mobile,
    e.full_name as registered_by,
    e.username,
    m.created_at
FROM bla_members m
LEFT JOIN employees e ON m.registered_by_employee_id = e.id
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;
```

### Count Registrations Per Employee:

```sql
SELECT 
    e.full_name as employee_name,
    e.username,
    COUNT(m.id) as total_registrations
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN bla_members m ON e.id = m.registered_by_employee_id
WHERE e.is_admin = true
GROUP BY e.id, e.full_name, e.username
ORDER BY total_registrations DESC;
```

### Find Untracked Members:

```sql
-- Members without employee tracking
SELECT 
    full_name,
    mobile,
    created_at
FROM bla_members
WHERE registered_by_employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
