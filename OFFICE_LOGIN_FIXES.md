# Office Login Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase Configuration Not Loaded Error
**Problem:** `office-login.js` was trying to call `getSupabaseClient()` but `supabase-config.js` wasn't included in the HTML before it.

**Solution:** Added `<script src="supabase-config.js"></script>` before `office-login.js` in `office-login.html`.

### 2. Password Visibility Toggle Not Working
**Problem:** The eye icon click wasn't triggering the password visibility toggle function.

**Solution:** 
- Added null checks in `togglePasswordVisibility()` function
- Wrapped the event listener with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to ensure it fires properly
- Added conditional checks before attaching event listeners

### 3. Environment Configuration
**Created:**
- `.env` file with actual Supabase credentials
- `env.local.json` file that the frontend loads (generated from .env)

## Files Modified

1. **office-login.html**
   - Added `supabase-config.js` script tag before `office-login.js`

2. **office-login.js**
   - Enhanced `togglePasswordVisibility()` with null checks
   - Improved event listener attachment with proper event handling
   - Added null checks before attaching form event listeners

3. **New Files Created:**
   - `.env` - Environment variables (not committed to git)
   - `env.local.json` - Runtime config loaded by supabase-config.js

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Open `office-login.html` in your browser
2. Verify that:
   - The page loads without console errors
   - Clicking the eye icon toggles password visibility
   - The password field shows/hides text correctly
   - Login form can connect to Supabase (check console for "Supabase initialized successfully")

## Next Steps

If you still see errors:
1. Check browser console for any new error messages
2. Verify `env.local.json` is being loaded (check Network tab)
3. Ensure Supabase credentials in `.env` are correct and active
