## 🚀 3 Simple Steps to Load Real Data

### Step 1: Export from Supabase (2 minutes)

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to **Table Editor** → **bla_members** table
3. Click **three dots (⋮)** or **"..."** at top
4. Click **"Export as JSON"** or **"Download"**
5. Save the file to your computer

### Step 2: Format the File (1 minute)

Your exported file probably looks like this:
```json
[
  {"id":1, "full_name":"Name 1", ...},
  {"id":2, "full_name":"Name 2", ...},
  ...
]
```

You need to wrap it like this:
```json
{
  "exportDate": "2025-10-14T22:40:00.000Z",
  "totalMembers": 90,
  "members": [
    {"id":1, "full_name":"Name 1", ...},
    {"id":2, "full_name":"Name 2", ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Quick way:**
1. Open the exported file in Notepad/VS Code
2. Add these 3 lines at the TOP:
   ```
   {
     "exportDate": "2025-10-14T22:40:00.000Z",
     "totalMembers": 90,
     "members":
   ```
3. Add ONE line at the BOTTOM:
   ```
   }
   ```
4. Save as **`members-data.json`** in folder: **`d:\USER\tvk\`**

### Step 3: Test It! (30 seconds)

```powershell
# 1. Validate the file (optional but recommended)
node validate-json.js

# 2. Open the page
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/member-photos.html
# Press Ctrl+F5 to refresh
```

**DONE!** All 90 members should load instantly! 🎉

## 🆘 If You Need Help

### File Format Errors
```powershell
# Use the validator to find issues
node validate-json.js
```

### Can't Export from Supabase
- Try copying data directly from the table view
- Use `members-data-SAMPLE.json` as template
- Manually format your data following the sample

### Page Not Loading
- Make sure server is running (should be!)
- Hard refresh: **Ctrl + F5**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Want to Update Data Later
When you add new members:
1. Re-export from Supabase
2. Replace `members-data.json`
3. Refresh page with Ctrl+F5
4. New members appear!
