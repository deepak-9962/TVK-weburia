## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Employee not found in database"
**Solution:** Make sure you completed Step 3 - adding employee records via the management panel.

### Issue: "Cannot read property 'id' of null"
**Solution:** Verify the employee's email in Supabase Auth matches the email in the employees table.

### Issue: "Members not showing in report"
**Solution:** 
1. Verify employee registered members while logged in
2. Check database: `SELECT * FROM bla_members WHERE registered_by_employee_id IS NOT NULL`
3. Ensure employee session was active during registration

### Issue: "Permission denied when viewing report"
**Solution:** Login as admin, not as employee. Employee report is admin-only.
