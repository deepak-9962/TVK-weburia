## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON public.areas
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Issue: Login fails with valid credentials
**Solution:** 
1. Verify user exists in Supabase Auth
2. Check if email verification is required
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Pre-fill not working
**Solution:**
1. Check URL has parameters: `?voterId=ABC1234567&partNumber=145`
2. Verify field IDs are correct: `voterNumber`, `partNumber`
3. Check console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Session expires quickly
**Solution:** Increase JWT expiry in Supabase Project Settings
