## 🔐 Security Options

### Current Setup:
- ✅ Site is public (anyone with link can access)
- ⚠️ All member data visible to anyone

### If You Want Privacy:

**Option A: Password Protection (Simple)**
I can add a JavaScript password prompt before showing data.

**Option B: Netlify Password Protection (Better)**
```toml
# Add this to netlify.toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
```
Then enable site password in Netlify settings.

**Option C: Supabase Auth (Professional)**
Add full login system with Supabase authentication.

**Recommendation:** Start public, add password later if needed.
