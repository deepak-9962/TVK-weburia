## 📸 New Photo Upload Flow:

### Before:
1. User selects photo
2. Photo shows as base64 preview
3. Photo stored as **massive base64 string** in database (1-2 MB per photo)

### After:
1. User selects/captures photo 📷
2. **Crop modal appears** with interactive cropping tool ✂️
3. User adjusts photo (move, zoom, resize crop area)
4. User clicks "பயன்படுத்து" (Apply)
5. Photo uploads to **Supabase Storage** (member-photos bucket) ☁️
6. Only the **public URL** (~100 bytes) is stored in database
7. Photos are served from CDN (fast & efficient)
